Sentiment analysis is commonly referred to as opinion mining. It entails the study of textual data to identify the underlying emotional tone or attitude expressed in the text. Classifying text into positive, neutral, or negative is the main goal of sentiment analysis. This classification offers useful perceptions of the tone of a text, such as product reviews or film criticism. The major goal of this particular paper is to use several machine-learning approaches to improve sentiment analysis. A valuable method for predicting the tone of movie reviews and determining how people feel about particular goods or services is the incorporation of machine learning into sentiment analysis. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Logistic Regression, RNN are just a few of the machine learning techniques that are thoroughly surveyed in this study. The study carefully considers each method's degrees of accuracy, benefits, and restrictions. Remarkably, the study shows that a hybrid model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and GRU outperforms all other algorithms taken into account, with an astounding 94% accuracy. This study highlights the promise of machine learning in sentiment analysis and its capacity to produce incredibly accurate results, which can help decision-makers in a variety of fields make better-informed choices.
